> Roadmap to becoming a web developer in 2018

## Disclaimer
> This roadmap was originally created with the intent of guiding developers through the hard and slow process of becoming a good software developer, showing paths that they can follow to learn what they need to know to be good professionals. I forked this repository to structure my own study plan based on the roadmaps presented here and to adapt it to my reality structuring the content according to what I want and what I have to learn.
